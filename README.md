# Servlet-XML
A simple tutorial on a servlet that returns our object as a XML file.


## We will use:

   * **Java**;
   * **JAXB**, a API for manipulating XML ;
   * **Java-CRUD** a simple CRUD project, that will be used as basis for this one. Consists of a class that handles our object, a persistence layer and a service class to manipulate that layer. Any doubt, the Java-CRUD ReadMe file explains all the workflow and classes involved of this project. The comments on the CRUD projetc were opmized and the *_StepByStep* was tranformed into *_CRUDtest*.
